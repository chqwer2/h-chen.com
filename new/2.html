<p>
I am an associate professor of <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> and I co-lead the <a href="https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/">Princeton NLP Group</a>.
I am also an associate director of <a href="https://pli.princeton.edu/">Princeton Language and Intelligence (PLI)</a>.
<!-- I am also a member of the <a href="https://aiml.cs.princeton.edu/">Princeton AIML group</a> and affiliated with <a href="https://csml.princeton.edu/">Princeton Center for Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML)</a>. -->
Previously, I was a visiting scientist at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in Seattle, working with <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz">Luke Zettlemoyer</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2018, where I was advised by <a href = "https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/">Christopher Manning</a> and worked in the <a href = "https://nlp.stanford.edu/">Stanford NLP Group</a>.
Before that, I was an undergraduate student in the <a href = "https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/"> Special Pilot CS Class</a> supervised by <a href = "https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yao/"> Andrew Yao</a> at Tsinghua University.

<br><br>
My research explores the full life cycle of language models—how we build, align, and understand them—with a focus on developing methods that democratize their creation and deployment.

<br><br>

I am currently on sabbatical leave from Princeton University, working as a member of technical staff at <a href="https://thinkingmachines.ai/">Thinking Machines Lab</a>.

<!-- <h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>
My research interests lie broadly in natural language processing and machine learning. I am always excited about simple and principled approaches that are practical, scalable, and generalizable in real-world problems.
<br><br>
These days, I am mostly drawn by the development of <b>large language models</b>. A list of topics that I am actively thinking about/working on:
<ul>
<li>I believe <b>retrieval</b> should play a fundamental role in next-generation language models to improve their factuality, adaptability, interpretability, and trustworthiness. We are actively exploring how to build effective retrievers and how to integrate retrieval with language models to achieve optimal trade-offs. </li>
<li>I am passionate about techniques that can potentially <b>democratize training and deployment of large language models</b> (especially making them accessible in academia), ranging from improved training approaches, data curation, optimization to model compression and downstream adaptations.</li>
<li>I am also interested in research that advances our <b>understanding</b> of current language models (capabilities and limitations), both empirically and theoretically. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Prospective students</b>:  I am actively looking for strong and motivated students to join our group! If you are interested in working with me, please apply through the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad">Princeton CS PhD program</a> and mention me in your application (and I can't respond to individual emails).
<br><br>
<b>Princeton students</b>: (1) If you are already a <b>graduate student</b> at Princeton, feel free to reach out. (2) <b>Undergraduate students</b>: Considering my bandwidth and current group size, I won't be able to take on more undergraduate advisees for senior thesis and independent work in AY23-24 unfortunately. You are always welcome to reach out directly to my <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/lab.html">graduate students</a> and work with them (a good starting point is to check out our <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/papers.html">recent publications</a>, and send them an email/schedule a chat!). We also strongly encourage you take COS324/COS484 first, and also fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/8sp37dy4j6k1nCZq5">this form</a> before you reach out.
<br>
<br> -->
<!-- I also have weekly <a href="https://calendly.com/danqic/office-hours">office hours</a> for Princeton students (undergraduate and graduate). If you would like to discuss any topic with me, feel free to sign up for them (10-minute each; you can book multiple if needed). -->
