## Preface

Just finished a small talk with Alex, my study partner, who is major in AI but extremely energetic when talking about statistics and linear algebra. 

Last semester, I had a great time audited his Neuron Computation course, which had clear and direct teaching that makes the hard mathematical theory easy to understand.

He showed me his new timetable, I decide to follow as many as them. As a master student, my timetable have already very enriched, now my timetable becomes:

|               | Monday                    | Tuesday                              | Wednesday                          | Thursday                 | Friday                                               |
