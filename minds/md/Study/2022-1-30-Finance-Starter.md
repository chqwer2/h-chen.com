> “Yeah, Let’s go Finance. ”

## In the Very Beginning

I happened to attend the [Financial Markets](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global) in **Coursera** during my lock-down after arriving British, which I count as my first formal course in Finance.

Prof. Robert Shiller always put a smile on his face when he is teaching, he tried to used some simple cases to convey non-trivial concepts in Finance Markets, such as Mutual Funds, Close-end Funds and ETF.

It was quite complicated for me at my first time going through this due to the language and discipline boundaries. But it is worthwhile to bear with the uncomfortable at the very beginning and start my Financial Journey!

I will try to re-go the whole course and summarize what I learn from it. Hopefully I won’t give up, LOL.

That is also some courses recommended list below, which I haven’t finished yet:
