> “Yeah, Let’s go Psychology. ”

## In the Very Beginning

Sigmund Freud and B.F.Skinner, who even you are not a psychological guy will probably knew it. They have profound influence in psy-research and also on me.

I had read some books about psychology and found out it is my field of insterest. Not the kind of research field insterest, but the insterest of knowing why people are thinking in certain way.

So I took the [Introduction of Psychology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-psychology/home/welcome) and finished months ago. It is a very practical course for the starter, illustrating inside-out some theories of Freud, Skinner and Piaget, also some appealing experiments and probably explaination on how and why people behave in some ways given specific environment. 

Unfortunately, I lost my notes of it, but it also gives me another chances to review this facinating course. 



# Reverse psychology

**Reverse psychology** is a technique involving the assertion of a belief or behavior that is opposite to the one desired, with the  expectation that this approach will encourage the subject of the  persuasion to do what is actually desired. This technique relies on the  psychological phenomenon of [reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)), in which a person has a negative emotional reaction to being persuaded, and thus chooses the option which is being advocated against. This may work especially well on a person who is resistant by nature,  while direct requests works best for people who are compliant. The one being [manipulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation) is usually unaware of what is really going on.
