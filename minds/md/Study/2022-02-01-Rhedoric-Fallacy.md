## What Is a Logical Fallacy?

Logical fallacies are flawed, deceptive, or false arguments that can be proven wrong with reasoning. There are two main types of fallacies:

- A **formal fallacy** is an argument with a premise and conclusion that doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
- An **informal fallacy** is an error in the form, content, or context of the argument.

## 15 Types of Logical Fallacies

#### 1. Ad Hominem 

#### (Against the Person诉诸人身谬论)

An ad hominem fallacy uses personal attacks rather than logic. This fallacy occurs when someone rejects or criticizes another point of view based on the personal characteristics, ethnic background, physical appearance, or other non-relevant traits of the person who holds it.

对某人的观点或立场的判断，是基于这个人的人格特征，种族背景，社会地位，外表等等，而没有给出理由。

#### 2. Straw Man 稻草人谬论

A straw man argument attacks a different subject rather than the topic being discussed — often a more extreme version of the counter argument. 

The purpose of this misdirection is to make **one's position/argument look **stronger** than it actually is./One has the tendency to interpret the **other party's position/argument** as **weak** in the discussions. 

论证中无意中歪曲对手的论点或立场，并宣称对方的原始立场是错误的。

#### 3. Appeal to Ignorance 诉诸无知谬论

An appeal to ignorance (also known as an "argument from ignorance") argues that a proposition must be true because it has not been proven false or there is no evidence against it.

e.g. 1）因为你不能证明X是假，所以X是真

​       2）因为你不能证明Y是真，所以Y是假

#### 4. False Dilemma/False Dichotomy 假两难谬论

A false dilemma or false dichotomy presents limited options — typically by focusing on two extremes — when in fact more possibilities exist. 

提出少数选项，要人从中选一，但这些选择未涵盖所有可能性。

e.g. The phrase "America: Love it or leave it" is an example of a false dilemma.

#### 5. Slippery Slope 滑坡谬论

A slippery slope argument assumes that a certain course of action will necessarily lead to a chain of future events. The slippery slope fallacy takes a benign premise or starting point and suggests that it will lead to unlikely or ridiculous outcomes with no supporting evidence.

不合理地使用连串的因果关系，将“可能性”转化为“必然性”

e.g. You may have used this fallacy on your parents as a teenager: "But you have to let me go to the party! If I don't go to the party, I'll be a loser with no friends. Next thing you know, I'll end up alone and jobless, living in your basement when I'm 30!"

#### 6. Circular Argument 循环论证谬误

#### （Begging the question 乞题）

[循环论证 - 万维百科 (wanweibaike.net)](https://www.wanweibaike.net/wiki-循環論證)

Circular arguments occur when a person's argument repeats what they already assumed before without arriving at a new conclusion. 

For example, if someone says, "According to my brain, my brain is reliable," that's a circular argument.

德国人的民族性很严谨，所以德国人做的车一定质量很好。

#### 7. Hasty Generalization 草率概括谬误

A hasty generalization is a claim based on a few examples rather than substantial proof. Arguments based on hasty generalizations often don't hold up due to a lack of supporting evidence: The claim might be true in one case, but that doesn't mean it's always true.

基于不充分的，甚至不相关的证据，草率得出结论

#### 8. Red Herring 红鲱鱼谬论

A red herring is an argument that uses confusion or distraction to shift attention away from a topic and toward a false conclusion. Red herrings usually contain an unimportant fact, idea, or event that has little relevance to the real issue.

Red herrings are a common diversionary tactic when someone wants to shift the focus of an argument to something easier or safer to address. But red herrings can also be unintentional.

转移话题谬误，就是把一个不相干的话题，按一定技巧穿插进来，把对方注意力和讨论方向转移到另一个论题上，从而赢得论战。

{由来：鲱鱼是一种鱼，本来不是红色的，经过用腌制和熏制以后就变成深红色了。并带有强烈的气味。人们把烟熏好的红鲱鱼，放在有狐狸出没的地方，来测试猎犬的搜寻能力。后来，人们用红鲱鱼来表示为迷惑对手而提出的错误的线索或伪造的事实，最早出现在1420年左右，其比喻义直到1884年才开始使用。}

#### 9. Appeal to Hypocrisy/The ‘Who are you to talk?’/‘You Too/Tu Quoque Fallacy 你也一样谬误

It is an attempt to divert blame. It focuses on the hypocrisy of an opponent. The tu quoque fallacy deflects criticism away from oneself by accusing the other person of the same problem or something comparable.

e.g.

Doctor: You should quit smoking. It’s a serious health risk.
Patient: Look who’s talking! I’ll quit when you quit.

#### 10. Causal Fallacy 归因谬误

Causal fallacies are informal fallacies that occur when an argument incorrectly concludes that a cause is related to an effect. Think of the causal fallacy as a parent category for other fallacies about unproven causes.

1. false cause fallacy 假因

draw a conclusion about what the cause was without enough evidence to do so. 证据不足的情况下做的归因

2. post hoc fallacy 后此

you mistake something for the cause because it came first — not because it actually caused the effect. 用一件事先发生来证明这件事就是后面发生的事情的原因

e.g.“昨天，我从梯子下面穿过、把打开的伞放在屋里、打翻了盐、遇到了黑猫，却忘了用幸运骰子敲木头。这就是为什么今天遇到了一堆糟心事儿。真倒霉。”

#### 11. Sunk Cost 沉没成本谬论

A sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues doing something because of the effort they already put in it, regardless of whether the additional costs outweigh the potential benefits. 

"Sunk cost" is an economic term for any past expenses that can no longer be recovered.

e.g. "I know this relationship isn't working anymore and that we're both miserable. No marriage. No kids. No steady job. But I've been with him for seven years, so I'd better stay with him."

#### 12. Appeal to Authority 诉诸权威谬误

Appeal to authority is the misuse of an authority's opinion to support an argument. While an authority's opinion can represent evidence and data, it becomes a fallacy if their expertise or authority is overstated, illegitimate, or irrelevant to the topic.

引用某一权威的话来证明结论，妄图使人信服，而该权威可能对这一论题并没有特别的专门知识，甚至与普通人无异。

e.g. "One day robots will enslave us all. It's true. My computer science teacher says so."

#### 13. Equivocation 含糊不清谬误

Equivocation happens when a word, phrase, or sentence is used deliberately to confuse, deceive, or mislead. In other words, saying one thing but meaning another.在不同一个语境中，有些词有不同的意思，有些人把这些词全部含糊等价起来，从而推导出荒唐的谬误。

e.g.

> 塞缪尔·约翰逊说过：爱国主义是流氓无赖们最后的藏身之地。而杨靖宇是一个爱国主义者，所以杨靖宇是个流氓无赖。

塞缪尔·约翰逊在说这话的时候，是为了抨击那些以爱国为名，谋求私利的虚伪政客。而杨靖宇的爱国主义是反抗帝国主义入侵而为同胞谋求解放的行为。

这种谬误就是把两个不同语境的不同含义的词在一个论点里等同，从而达到含糊其意义的谬误论证。

#### 14. Appeal to Pity 诉诸同情谬误

An appeal to pity relies on provoking your emotions to win an argument rather than factual evidence. Appealing to pity attempts to pull on an audience's heartstrings, distract them, and support their point of view.

与所讨论主题的对错无关，而是通过利用他人的同情或者某些情感上的敏感去绕开主题

e.g. Someone accused of a crime using a cane or walker to appear more feeble in front of a jury is one example of appeal to pity. 

#### 15. Bandwagon Fallacy 诉诸群众谬误

The bandwagon fallacy assumes something is true (or right or good) because others agree with it. In other words, the fallacy argues that if everyone thinks a certain way, then you should, too.

潮流谬论是一种基于大众信仰和行为的辩论谬论，而不是基于有效的逻辑观点。基于这种谬论的论证通常具有类似于"其他人都相信这一点，所以它一定是真的"或"其他人都这样做"的格式。

e.g."Almost everyone at my school will be at the party Friday night. It must be the right thing to do."
